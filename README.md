# Emotion-Based-Music-Generation

This system creates personalized music based on your emotions! It uses cutting-edge technology to understand your emotions in real-time. Here's how it works:

Feeling Captured: OpenCV, a powerful computer vision library, is used to analyze your facial expressions through your webcam.
Emotion Decoded: A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, trained with TensorFlow, takes over. This AI brain analyzes the data from OpenCV and classifies your emotions with 75% accuracy. It can distinguish between happiness, sadness, anger, and other emotions.
Music to Your Mood: Finally, PyAudio steps in. Based on the emotion you're feeling, the system generates or selects music that matches your mood. It could be an uplifting tune for a happy moment or a calming piece for when you're feeling stressed.
